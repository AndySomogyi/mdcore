mdcore is an Open-Source platform-independent library for Molecular
Dynamics simulations. This project aims not to provide yet another
full-featured simulation package, but rather to provide the core
computational infrastructure for parallel MD in such a way that it can
be easily integrated into existing simulation packages or be used
directly for simple simulations. The library also provides a test bed
for the design and development of new algorithms for new architectures 
such as GPUs [1], the Cell/BE [2], or the Intel MIC, and to investigate
different strategies for hybrid shared/distributed-memory parallelism,
asynchronous communication and load balancing for multi-core architectures
on low-bandwidth/high-latency commodity networks.

mdcore currently incorporates the following functionality:

    * Task-based shared-memory parallelism for multi-core computers,
    * Hybrid shared/distributed memory parallelism for clusters of
      multi-core computers,
    * Support for multiple CUDA-capable GPUs,
    * Support for the Cell/BE,
    * Support for arbitrary potential functions.
